# Fluency
Spigot Menu API that removes the Boilerplate of creating Inventory GUIs


Note that Fluency is currently in beta and any API components are subject to change at any time, and not necessarily well documented.


# TODO
* Nothing major at the moment, bugfixes.
* Some significant refactors need to be made internally. The amount of spaghetti is
disturbing.
